# Welcome!
Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.

## Prerequisites:
To get going you need a few things installed. For more information look at the Laravel documentation [here.](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation#server-requirements)
- PHP
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
## Installation:
Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed. Download the Laravel installer using Composer:
```sh
$ composer global require laravel/installer
```

Unzip the project and go into the directory of the project
```sh
$ cd simpleResDash
```

Install composer dependancies
```sh
$ composer install
```
This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000:
```sh
$ php artisan serve
```
When running the command you should expect to see this:
```sh
Laravel development server started: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
```
Go to that address and you will be able to view the project!

## Extra goodies:
My project is built with VueJS. If you would like to see the components and how they react dynamically, download the [Vue DevTools.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)

From there you can open the Developer Tools and go to the Vue tab to see how the elements react while you navigate the application!
